This section is largely to document the various programming and art courses that I've and their statuses starting in October 2025. This is not a comprehensive list, but rather to explain some gaps in my personal project timeline. I actively enjoy learning and courses are the best way for me to learn new tech, frameworks and engines.

Warning: This section is largely under construction at the moment. The data might not be complete.
