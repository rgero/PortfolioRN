# Portfolio - Rewrite

Currently, my website is a simple React website that grabs data from Supabase to populate a list of my projects. I want to rewrite this, using React Native Web, to improve its appearance on both the desktop and mobile platforms. This is also going to be an experiment to see how comfortable I feel doing it in preparation for other projects.
